# Loan default Prediction - Lending Club Dataset

This is the README file for the Loan Default Prediction System project, I have built a system for predicting loan default using a dataset from LendingClub. This README provides an overview of the project, its objectives, data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and visualization.

## Project Overview

The Loan Default Prediction System aims to analyze a dataset containing information on loan applicants and predict whether a loan will be fully repaid or charged off. The project's objectives include data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model evaluation, and the use of visualizations to enhance our understanding of the data and model performance.
## Data Preprocessing 

Data preprocessing is a crucial step in ensuring the quality and relevance of the data for analysis. Key preprocessing steps include:

* Handling missing values in the dataset.

* Exploring the frequency distribution of employment length among loan applicants.

* Investigating the relationship between loan status and employment length.

The cleaned dataset has been saved as a new CSV file called "Loan_Repayment_Cleaned.csv."
## Exploratory Data Analysis

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is performed to gain insights into the dataset and identify patterns. Key EDA steps include:

* Analyzing the balance of loan status data.

* Investigating the distribution of loan amounts.

* Exploring correlations among numerical columns.

* Examining the relationships between loan amount and installment, loan status and loan amount, and loan status and subgrades.

These insights are crucial for understanding factors that affect loan repayment.
## Model Evaluation 

The project employs various classification models, including decision tree, naive Bayes, logistic regression, and KNN, to predict loan status. Model evaluation involves:

* Calculating AUC (Area Under the Curve) scores.

* Examining precision-recall curves.

* Analyzing confusion matrices to understand model performance.

The evaluation helps in selecting the most suitable model for predicting loan default.
## Visualization

Visualizations play a critical role in representing data and model results. Visualizations include:

* ROC Curve to compare model performance.

* Precision-Recall Curve to assess model precision and recall.

* Confusion matrices to analyze model accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

These visualizations aid in understanding the project's findings and conclusions.
